# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard, a company that has been around for a long time, to assess what employees are approaching retirement along with assessing what positions will be opening in the next few years. In this challenge I helped to determine the number of retiring employess by title along with determing the number of employees that were eligible for the mentorship program that Pewlett Hackard is launching. The criteria that we used to determine who was retiring shortly was based upon birth date years that ranged from 1952 - 1955.

## Results:

  - As we can see from the chart below, there is a large number of employees that are eligable for retirement. We can see that over 32,000 staff are eligable along with over 8,000 senior staff.

  - In addition to the staff and senior staff, we also can see that Pewlett Hackard is also going to see over 29,000 senior engineers and over 14,000 engineers.
  - Pewlett Hackard will want to focus on relacing this large percentage of their workforce in the coming years.
  - By focusing on all of these positions that will be opening, Pewlett Hackard will avoid not being prepared for this large turnover in employees.
